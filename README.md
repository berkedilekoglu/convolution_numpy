# Convolution and Pooling operations from scratch

Matrix implementation of a convolution, max and average pooling operation

* These can be used to build a neural network!
* Numpy will be used to implement from scratch
* To give a better illustration famous Lenna image and Gabor filters will be used

I highly recommend you to read this tutorial:

https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/

If you read and follow that course step by step with imptlementation you can understand the magic behind convolutional neural networks!
